# HackCooper2016

Currently, social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have "reporting" functions for users 
to flag inappropriate or otherwise offensive comments and posts; however, there is little to no 
incentive to use these functions, and so they are rarely if ever used.

Our project will implement a rewards system; similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, all users will get 
a badge on their profile that automatically increments each day and "ranks" up when certain thresholds 
are met. The badge will have a counter that resets if the user's posts have been reported as offensive; 
this will encourage users to improve their community, making their platform a safer space
for everyone (in spirit with http://www.hackharassment.com/).
